# Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a **marketing performance analysis** for a simulated marketing campaign run by *Freedom Debt Relief*. The objective was to evaluate the success of the campaign using **quantitative metrics** and recommend improvements for future marketing strategies.

The analysis is based on three datasets:

- `calendar_data.csv`
- `client_data.csv`
- `deposit_data.csv`

A Jupyter Notebook (`Marketing Data Analysis Project.ipynb`) contains all the data cleaning, analysis, and conclusions drawn from the campaign performance assessment.

## Business Scenario
Freedom Debt Relief launched a **$5 million marketing campaign** in **Month 3** to promote its debt relief program. The datasets provided cover **five months of data**, allowing for a **before-and-after analysis** of the campaign's effectiveness. The key questions explored include:

### 1. Was the campaign successful?
- What success metrics were used, and why?
- How many new clients were acquired during the campaign?
- How many were acquired after the campaign?

### 2. How can future campaigns be optimized?
- What adjustments should be made to enhance performance?

### 3. What if the campaign had been delayed?
- Would postponing the campaign to **Month 6** have yielded better results?

## Methodology & Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Imported, merged, and structured data using **Pandas**.
- Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing data.
- Ensured date formats were correctly aligned for time-series analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed **trends in client acquisition and deposits** before, during, and after the campaign.
- Created **visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn** to identify patterns.
- Used descriptive statistics to understand key data points.

### 3. Marketing Campaign Performance Evaluation
- Defined and applied **success metrics**, such as:
  - **Deposit Growth**: Analyzed the increase in total deposits pre- and post-campaign.
  - **Customer Acquisition Rate**: Measured new client sign-ups during and after the campaign.
  - **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Compared deposit growth against the $5M campaign cost.

### 4. Predictive Analysis & Scenario Simulation
- Conducted a **what-if analysis** to simulate the impact of delaying the campaign to **Month 6**.
- Compared projected deposit changes in different scenarios.

## Key Findings & Conclusion
- The **campaign increased total deposits by $26 million** compared to pre-campaign levels, proving its **strong impact on business growth**.
- **Postponing the campaign to Month 6 would have led to lower deposit growth**, with only an **$8 million** increase instead of **$26 million**.
- **Recommendations for future campaigns:**
  - Optimize budget allocation across multiple months for sustained impact.
  - Leverage customer segmentation for better targeting.
  - Test different campaign timings for peak engagement.
